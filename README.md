A cryptocurrency app that displays & looks-up current cryptocurrencies, finds the latest news and displays information on price, exchanges, markets, etc. I created this app mainly to gain experience with Redux Toolkit.

Updates to make: change api to bing search and add a line chart to coin details page. This gives me more data to pull from like picures for the news cards. Adding the line chart will give more information and depth to the page.
